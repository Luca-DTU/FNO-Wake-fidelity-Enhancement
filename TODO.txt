WRITING:
 - Abstract, preface, acknowledgements
 - Talk about societal impact and sustainability also of the neural network training and compute, 
  maybe this helps(https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-023-00506-2)
 - Update implementation section
 - put plots of losses
 - discuss the inference speed of the FNO

DEVELOPMENT:
 - Test on two outputs 
 - Test with another input parameter (CT, Ambient Turbulence)
 - Fine tune the FNO on a completely different low res example and see how it performs in high res
 - Can I make the network smaller without losing performance? --> check sensitivity of test loss to network size

APPEARANCE:
 - Code snippet in theory section yay or nay?
 - Have configuration on its own page in the implementation section, make it a table maybe?
 - first figure in experiments section looks like shit
CONTENT:
 - SuperResolution, yes or no?, decide and update, abstract and introduction(problem statement) accordingly
 - Thesis overview and novelty, to complete
 - Review related work section, enhance clarity and remove gpt sounding sentences
 - Keep losses section in implementation? yay or nay?
 - More talk about the multi-resolution training, maybe a comparison with other approaches? like a compare with a fine tuning approaches
 - Give weight to the novelty aspects, i.e. the multifidelity training and the loss weighting, check sch√≤ler and al to see if he had removed the hub
 - Restructure narrative in eperiments section, add more subsubsections in the rans awf part
 - Show the application of the model to some new strange geometry
 - how resolution invariant is the synthetic operator really?

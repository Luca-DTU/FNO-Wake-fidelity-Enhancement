WRITING:
 - Abstract, preface, acknowledgements
 - Fulfil Learning objectives fully for the 12:
   - Talk about societal impact and sustainability also of the neural network training and compute, 
   maybe this helps(https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-023-00506-2)
 - Add a mathematical description of the Tucker factorization
STRUCTURING:
 - Strcuture the value proposition along the two parallel developments:
    - Data-driven surrogate model
    - Fidelity enhancement model 

DEVELOPMENT:
 - Demonstrate the inference speed of the FNO
 - Test on two outputs 
 - Test with another input parameter
 - Fine tune the FNO on a completely different low res example and see how it performs in high res
 - Can I make the network smaller without losing performance
 - Try with a different ambient turbulence
 - Evaluate not only as function of angle but also of layout number, 
 noting that layout is structured in a way that you repeat the 10 layouts at five different spacings,
 you can plt it in a heatmap to show eventual dependencies



OTHER NOTES:
 - To apply in practice, you want to create a surrogate which takes into account the parameters as input
